# LinkedIn Learning Python course by Joe Marini
# Example file for variables and basic types


# Basic data types in Python: Numbers, Strings, Booleans 
# Variable names must start with a letter or _, and can have numbers. They are case sensitive. 
myint = 10
myfloat = 13.2576
mystr = "This is a string"
mybool = True

# We can display the content of a variable using the print() function
# print(myint)
# print(mystr)

# Operators are used to perform operations on variables
# print(myfloat + myint)
# print(myfloat * myint)
# print(myfloat / myint)
# print(myfloat % 3)

# another_str = "this is another string."

# print(mystr + " and " + another_str)

# Logical and comparison operators 


# re-declaring a variable works
